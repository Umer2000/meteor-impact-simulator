# 🌍 ImpactX — AI-Powered Planetary Defense Dashboard

**ImpactX** is an AI-driven web platform developed for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**.  
It transforms **NASA’s Near-Earth Object (NEO)** data into real-time, interactive insights — helping scientists, policymakers, and the public visualize asteroid trajectories, assess potential impact risks, and understand space data through AI-powered storytelling.

---

## 🚀 Overview

ImpactX combines **space data analytics**, **machine learning**, and **3D visualization** to predict and display asteroid behavior near Earth.  
Our mission is to make planetary defense data **accessible**, **intuitive**, and **impactful** — turning complex orbital datasets into meaningful visual narratives.
