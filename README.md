# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is currently not compatible with SWC. See [this issue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/issues/428) for tracking the progress.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# 🌍 ImpactX — AI-Powered Planetary Defense Dashboard

**ImpactX** is an AI-driven web platform developed for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**.  
It transforms **NASA’s Near-Earth Object (NEO)** data into real-time, interactive insights — helping scientists, policymakers, and the public visualize asteroid trajectories, assess potential impact risks, and understand space data through AI-powered storytelling.

---

## 🚀 Overview

ImpactX combines **space data analytics**, **machine learning**, and **3D visualization** to predict and display asteroid behavior near Earth.  
Our mission is to make planetary defense data **accessible**, **intuitive**, and **impactful** — turning complex orbital datasets into meaningful visual narratives.

---

## 🧠 Features

- 🌌 **Real-Time NASA NEO Data Integration**  
  Fetches and updates asteroid data directly from NASA APIs.
  
- 🧮 **Machine Learning Risk Estimation**  
  Predicts asteroid impact probabilities and severity levels.

- 🌐 **3D Interactive Visualization**  
  Displays orbital paths and potential Earth intersections using Three.js.

- 🗣️ **AI Narration & Explanations**  
  Uses Gemini + ElevenLabs for real-time storytelling of asteroid events.

- 📊 **Intuitive Dashboard**  
  Built with React.js for dynamic, user-friendly exploration of space data.

## 🧩 System Architecture

1. **Data Pipeline:** Fetches live asteroid data from NASA APIs.  
2. **Analysis Engine:** ML model predicts risk and trajectory probabilities.  
3. **Visualization Layer:** Three.js renders 3D asteroid paths.  
4. **Narration Module:** Gemini + ElevenLabs generate natural explanations.  
5. **Frontend Interface:** React.js dashboard displays analytics in real time.  

---

## 🎨 Creativity & Impact

We designed ImpactX to bridge **data science and storytelling**.  
By merging AI narration with 3D simulations, users can *see* and *hear* how asteroids move — turning raw space data into an immersive learning experience.  
Our goal: make planetary defense information **accessible, educational, and inspiring**.
